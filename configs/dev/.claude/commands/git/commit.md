argument-hint: [naming guidance]

Write a short and descriptive commit message and commit the current changes (only staged files) to the currently selected branch. If the branch has a separator, for example `TASK-123/my-featu
re` or `tech/refactoring-123`), use it as a tag in the commit message like this:
```
[tech] Refactor the agentic module
```
Do not push it to the remote, only commit.
